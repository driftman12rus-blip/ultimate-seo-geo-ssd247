## 15. Programmatic SEO

### Step by Step

1. **Assess data source** — Each record must have ≥3 distinct data points beyond the variable name.
2. **Design template** — Unique injection: title, H1, meta description, ≥30% of body content.
3. **Apply quality gates** — Hard stops below.
4. **Build internal linking** — Programmatic pages must link to pillar and cluster pages.
5. **noindex thin records** from day one.
6. **Human review** — 5–10% sample before publishing >100 pages.

### Quality review

Scale and measured text similarity are diagnostics, not automatic SEO violations. Do not create Critical/Warning findings from fixed page-count, word-count, or uniqueness-percentage thresholds alone. Escalate only when there is evidence of duplicate intent, substantially duplicate pages, doorway/scaled-abuse patterns, poor indexation, cannibalization, or other measurable search harm.

**Don't**: Approve city pages where only the city name changes — March 2024 Core Update target (60–80% traffic declines seen).

**Scaled Content Abuse enforcement timeline:**
- **November 2024**: Site reputation abuse enforcement escalated — publishing programmatic content under a high-authority domain you don't own triggers penalties
- **June 2025**: Wave of manual actions targeting AI-generated content at scale
- **August 2025**: SpamBrain update enhanced pattern detection for AI content farms and link schemes
- **Result**: Google reported 45% reduction in low-quality, unoriginal content in search results post-March 2024
- **Progressive rollout rule**: Publish in batches of 50–100 pages. Monitor indexing and rankings for 2–4 weeks before expanding. Never publish 500+ programmatic pages simultaneously without explicit quality review.

**Automated audit**: Run `scripts/programmatic_seo_auditor.py URL --depth 2 --max-pages 100 --json` to auto-detect template URL patterns and audit each group for boilerplate ratio, measured content similarity, title/description/H1 duplication, and cross-linking health. Word count and uniqueness percentages are descriptive diagnostics only; they do not create defects by themselves.
